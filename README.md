# Reboot01 Dashboard - Authentication Security

## Overview
This project implements a secure authentication system for the Reboot01 dashboard that prevents users from accessing the profile page after logout using browser navigation (back button, etc.). It also includes an engaging mini-game error page for better user experience during errors.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Checks
- **Multiple Event Listeners**: The app now listens for various browser events to check authentication:
  - `pageshow`: Triggers when page is shown from back/forward cache
  - `focus`: Triggers when window gains focus
  - `visibilitychange`: Triggers when user switches tabs
  - `DOMContentLoaded`: Initial page load check

### 2. Improved Logout Process
- **Complete Data Clearance**: On logout, the app clears:
  - JWT token from localStorage
  - All sessionStorage data
  - Browser cache (if available)
- **Force Redirect**: Uses `window.location.replace()` instead of `window.location.href` to prevent back button navigation

### 3. Cache Prevention
- **Meta Tags**: Added HTTP headers to prevent page caching:
  - `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
  - `Pragma: no-cache`
  - `Expires: 0`

### 4. Periodic Security Checks
- **30-second Intervals**: The app performs authentication checks every 30 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for network issues and invalid tokens

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- **401/403 Responses**: Automatically redirects to login on unauthorized responses
- **Invalid JWT Detection**: Detects and handles various JWT-related errors
- **Network Error Handling**: Handles authentication-related network errors

## ðŸŽ® Mini-Game Error Page

### Features
- **Space Defender Game**: A fun arcade-style game where players defend against falling asteroids
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Mouse movement to control ship, click to shoot
- **Score System**: Track your high score while waiting for issues to be resolved
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern gradient design with floating particles animation

### Game Controls
- **Move**: Use mouse to move the spaceship
- **Shoot**: Click to fire bullets at asteroids
- **Objective**: Destroy asteroids before they reach the bottom
- **Lives**: You have 3 lives - don't let asteroids pass!

### Error Scenarios
The mini-game is integrated into the 404 page and is triggered for:
- Network connection errors
- Server errors (500+ status codes)
- Invalid data responses
- GraphQL query errors
- General application errors
- 404 page not found errors

### Files
- `404.html` - Complete error page with integrated mini-game
- `break-api.js` - Console commands for testing error scenarios

## How It Works

1. **Page Load**: Authentication is checked immediately when the page loads
2. **Browser Navigation**: When user uses back/forward buttons, authentication is re-checked
3. **Tab Switching**: Authentication is verified when user returns to the tab
4. **Periodic Checks**: Regular authentication validation every 30 seconds
5. **Logout**: Complete cleanup and forced redirect to login page
6. **Error Handling**: Users are redirected to engaging mini-game instead of boring error messages

## Testing the Security

To test the authentication security:

1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Navigate to the profile page
3. Click logout
4. Try using the browser's back button
5. You should be immediately redirected to the login page

## Testing the Error Page

To test the mini-game error page:

1. Disconnect your internet connection
2. Try to log in or access the dashboard
3. You should be redirected to the error page with the Space Defender game
4. Enjoy playing while waiting for connection to be restored!

## Browser Compatibility

This solution works across all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Chromium
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to Netlify or other hosting platforms:
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled for secure token transmission
- The cache prevention meta tags will help with browser caching issues
- The periodic authentication checks provide additional security layers
- The mini-game error page provides better user experience during downtime
